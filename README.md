### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### Tuning your database

# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/3lucasrs/taskease.git

# Access the project folder in your terminal
$ cd taskease

# Access the backend folder
$ cd backend

# Install the dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the application with nodemon
$ nodemon src/server.js

# The app will open on the port: 3001 - go to http://localhost:3001/

```

#### Running the web application (Front-end)
